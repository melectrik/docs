ViUR is an application development framework that focuses on cloud-based information systems implemented on top of the Google AppEngineâ„¢ (GAE).

ViUR is designed to enable applications which are simple, clear, flexible, extensible, versatile, high-scalable and easy-to-use. To fit the requirements of modern agile software development workflows, ViUR is entirely written in the Python programming language.

Applications implemented in ViUR are not limited to websites or any other kind of specialized web-application. Therefore we call ViUR an information system, because it goes beyond the limitations of a content-management-system or other kinds of specialized web-application software.

ViUR helps to manage any kind of information. It comes with a set of four pre-defined prototypes which can be used to build modules for any desired tasks. Pre-defined modules can easily be adapted for particular goals. New modules are simply created or extended from other ones. Data structures can be defined, extended and changed during the development workflow. Input masks and data management interfaces are dynamically created within the administration tools.

ViUR currently consists of three parts:

The server is the core of a ViUR application.

It provides the server-parts of the web-application, a library of pre-defined data-models, modules, tools and libraries for data management, and several renders for different types of output.

The admin is the client-based administration backend used to manage a ViUR application.

It is cross-platform capable and focuses on power-users that want to manage their applications with the full power of a desktop client computer.

The vi (visual interface) is the web-based administration backend.

It is an easy-to-access management tool. Written in pure HTML5, it runs system-independently in the web-browser and can be used on any desktop or mobile device.

Both administration tools support the integration of application-specific plug-ins and can be used independently, depending on what is wanted and required.
