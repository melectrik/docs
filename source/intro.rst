What is ViUR?
=============

ViUR is a software development framework for the `Google AppEngine™`_ (GAE).

It provides a clear concept for implementing agile data management software that runs on top of the Google cloud platform. It is written in the `Python programming language`_ for a maximum flexibility and easy-to-manage code. Its underlying database is Googles `Cloud Datastore`_, which is a scalable document database.

ViUR is explicitly not claimed to be a content management system - it can be used as one, but there are lots of other, more individual cases a ViUR system could be. Therefore, ViUR is called to be an *information system*. It manages information of any kind in a style and way that is determined by the developer.
