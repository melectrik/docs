Welcome to ViUR!

ViUR is a powerful application development framework that mainly focuses on web-based
cloud application development on top of the `Google AppEngine™`_ and by using the
`Python programming language`_.

ViURs design goals are:

- Simplicity
- High-scalability
- Universal targets
- Re-usability
- entirely based on an agile software development flow.

This manual should provide a detailed on-line documentation about how ViURs internals
work and how to deal with the several modules and libraries.
